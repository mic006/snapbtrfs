# Snapshots will be stored in a dedicated sub folder, with the name of the subvolume
# example: 'home' subvolume snapshots will be stored in 'snaps/home/'

# Default settings for kept snapshots
# For each periodicity, indicates the number of snapshots to be kept
# Note: if hourly is 0, a snapshot will be taken only if the previous one is at least a full day old
